        <h3>üé¨ THE WES ANDERSON STYLE EXPLAINED üé¨</h3>

        <hr />

        <p class="text">
          The Wes Anderson style is hard to miss. From his cinematography,
          production design, color, and music, there‚Äôs just no mistaking Wes
          Anderson movies. His creative and stylistic fingerprints can be found
          in his work from top to bottom ‚Äî and this is what makes him a true
          auteur.
          <br />
          <br />

          <span class="titles"> Story </span>

          <br />

          It's known that Anderson crafts his stories from the perspectives of
          young adults. But the other thing Anderson does so well is building
          ensembles of flawed misfits. They're also walking contradictions. The
          children act like adults. And the adults act like children. If you
          want to build a story like Anderson, write flawed characters with
          selfish desires and make them walking contradictions.

          <br />

          </span>
          <br />

          <span class="titles"> Production Design </span>
          <br />

          The production design in Wes Anderson films is undeniably unique. He
          does this primarily through costumes and set design, which are meant
          to act as representations of either the characters or the story. Take
          the costumes in <strong>The Royal Tenenbaums</strong>. Chas's life has
          been chaotic. His father tormented him as a boy, his wife was killed
          in a fire, he is running from his past. So, Anderson dresses him and
          his sons in jogging suits. Anderson knows it's the clothes that make
          the man. Anderson also makes sure that his settings are also
          characters. In <strong>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</strong>,
          the set dressing is robust, implies a rich history, and helps to build
          mood and tone. Anderson knows that Steve's boat is a character. So, he
          shows you the layout, the personality, and its flaws.

          </span>
          <br />

          <span class="titles"> Color</span>
          <br />

          Anderson builds his worlds around color. The browns and yellows of
          <strong>Moonrise Kingdom</strong>, or the blues and reds of
          <strong>The Life Aquatic</strong>. His use of pastel shades supports
          his charming and vintage sensibilities. Color can effectively build
          mood and tone, but color can also be used as a narrative device, like
          the colors in <strong>The Grand Budapest Hotel</strong>. In the early
          years when the hotel was in its heyday, notice the color choices:
          bright red walls, rich purples, soft and inviting pinks. Now look at
          the colors when it's past its prime: burnt oranges, drab greens, wood
          tones. The change in color presents the status of the hotel. As the
          prestige faded, so did the colors.

          Wes Anderson is known for his symmetrical framing. It's a constant
          throughout his works. The symmetry is a nice calling card, but it's
          just one aspect of Anderson's style. A large part of what makes a Wes
          Anderson shot is how he frames for mise-en-sc√®ne, where every element
          in the frame is carefully considered and functions to depict space,
          time period, theme, plot, and character. As a result, he uses
          composition, blocking, and camera movement to create a complex ballet.
          It is also important to notice the change in aspect ratio throughout
          <strong>The Grand Budapest Hotel</strong>. In the a980's intro, it's
          in 1.85; in the 1960's, it's an anamorphic 2.4; and in 1930's, it's
          the academy 1.37. Anderson uses his aspect ratios to suggest the time
          period and mood of the story.

          <span class="titles"> Music </span>
          <br />

          The music in Wes Anderson's films are often a mixture of folk and euro
          rock. This can include original scores, but also songs from his
          childhood. The music choices are all about reinforcing the energy of
          the scenes. Take the music from <strong>The Life Aquatic</strong>. The
          film uses a combination of an original score composed by Mark
          Mothersbaugh, but also David Bowie, with covers by Seu Jorge. During
          the shootout, he leverages the adrenaline kick of "Search and Destroy"
          by Iggy and the Stooges, but during a particularly sad moment, he uses
          "The Way I Feel Inside" by The Zombies.
